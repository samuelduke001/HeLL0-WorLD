Ellie Webbs Test Cases 20190913
SignalPath has bought a new vending machine and it is going to be under heavy usage (we love snacks). You have been nominated to test it and make sure it is up to the task. How would you approach this?
Create two test cases for Twitter’s authentication functionality.
Using any tool of your choice, create an automated test for one of the two test cases from the previous question (Twitter); or if your scripting knowledge is limited, discuss how you would go about testing the test case using automation.
Suppose you have a web site with two form elements on it: a multi-line textarea and button that says “multiply”. The expected behavior is that when you click “multiply” all of the numbers written in the textarea are multiplied together and written next to the textarea. For instance, if the textarea has the numbers 5, 7, 11 then the output will be 385. Identify all the test cases that you would need to write. (You do not actually need to write the detailed steps for every test case, just the summary.)
